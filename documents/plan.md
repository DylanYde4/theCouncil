# theCouncil API System Plan

## Overview

theCouncil is a flexible API system designed to be called by different GPT models. The system allows dynamic creation of endpoint groups through a console interface, enabling quick implementation of new automation features without requiring code changes.

## Core Features

1. **Dynamic Endpoint Group Creation**: Create new endpoint groups through a console interface by simply providing a name and basic configuration.
2. **Domain-Driven Design Architecture**: Organized around business domains with clear boundaries and contexts.
3. **GPT Integration**: Optimized for being called by various GPT models, with consistent response formats.
4. **Flexible Database Support**: Multiple database options based on use case requirements.
5. **Automation Framework**: Each group of endpoints represents an "automation" that can be managed independently.

## Technical Architecture (DDD Approach)

### 1. Core Architecture Layers

```
theCouncil/
├── src/
│   ├── domain/              # Domain models, entities, value objects
│   ├── application/         # Application services, use cases, DTOs
│   ├── infrastructure/      # External services, repositories, database adapters
│   ├── interfaces/          # API controllers, CLI interfaces
│   └── shared/              # Shared kernel, cross-cutting concerns
├── tests/                   # Test suite
└── documents/               # Documentation
```

### 2. Dynamic Endpoint System

The system will implement a plugin-based architecture for endpoint groups:

```
src/
├── domain/
│   └── automation/          # Core domain for automation management
├── application/
│   ├── automation_registry/ # Registry for automation endpoint groups
│   └── automation_factory/  # Factory for creating new automations
└── interfaces/
    └── api/
        ├── router_manager/  # Dynamic FastAPI router management
        └── automations/     # Auto-generated endpoint groups
            ├── accounts/    # Example: Accounts automation endpoints
            └── other_groups/# Other dynamically created endpoint groups
```

### 3. Console Management Interface

A web-based console will allow:
- Creating new endpoint groups (automations)
- Configuring endpoints within each group
- Managing permissions and access
- Viewing analytics on endpoint usage

## Database Strategy

The system will implement a database selector pattern that allows choosing the appropriate database technology based on the specific needs of each automation endpoint group.

### Database Options

| Database Type | Best Use Cases | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| PostgreSQL | - Complex relational data<br>- Transactional systems<br>- Structured data with relationships | - ACID compliance<br>- Advanced querying<br>- Strong consistency | - Vertical scaling limitations<br>- Complex setup for high availability |
| MongoDB | - Semi-structured data<br>- High write throughput<br>- Evolving schemas | - Schema flexibility<br>- Horizontal scaling<br>- Document-oriented | - Limited transaction support<br>- Less mature query optimization |
| Redis | - Caching<br>- Real-time data<br>- Leaderboards/counters | - Extremely fast<br>- Built-in data structures<br>- Pub/Sub capability | - Memory constraints<br>- Less durable by default<br>- Limited query capabilities |
| Elasticsearch | - Full-text search<br>- Log analytics<br>- Complex search requirements | - Powerful search capabilities<br>- Distributed by design<br>- Analytics features | - Resource intensive<br>- Complex configuration<br>- Eventually consistent |
| DynamoDB | - Serverless applications<br>- High-scale applications<br>- Key-value access patterns | - Fully managed<br>- Auto-scaling<br>- Consistent performance | - Limited query patterns<br>- Pricing complexity<br>- Vendor lock-in |

### Database Adapter Pattern

The system will implement a database adapter pattern allowing each automation to utilize the most appropriate database:

```
infrastructure/
├── database/
│   ├── base_repository.py       # Abstract repository interface
│   ├── postgresql/              # PostgreSQL implementation
│   ├── mongodb/                 # MongoDB implementation
│   ├── redis/                   # Redis implementation
│   └── elasticsearch/           # Elasticsearch implementation
└── database_factory.py          # Factory to create appropriate repositories
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Framework
1. Set up FastAPI project structure with DDD architecture
2. Implement basic authentication and authorization
3. Create the dynamic router system for automations
4. Develop the database adapter pattern

### Phase 2: Console Interface
1. Build the web console for managing automations
2. Implement the automation creation workflow
3. Add configuration interfaces for endpoints
4. Create documentation generation for APIs

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Add GPT-specific optimizations for API responses
2. Implement monitoring and analytics
3. Add versioning support for automations
4. Create testing tools for automations

## Development Approach

- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite for all components
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Documentation**: Automatic API documentation generation
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent development and deployment

## Example: Creating an "Accounts" Automation

1. User accesses the console
2. Creates new automation named "Accounts"
3. System generates:
   - Base routes at `/accounts/`
   - Starter code templates
   - Database connection options
4. User configures specific endpoints:
   - `GET /accounts/` - List accounts
   - `POST /accounts/` - Create account
   - `GET /accounts/{id}` - Get account details
5. User selects PostgreSQL as the database
6. System automatically:
   - Generates FastAPI route definitions
   - Creates database models and repositories
   - Sets up validation schemas
   - Provides OpenAPI documentation

## Security Considerations

- API key management for GPT access
- Role-based access control for console users
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Input validation for all endpoints
- Audit logging for all operations
