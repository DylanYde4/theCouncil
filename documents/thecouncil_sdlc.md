## Workflow & Processes

### Git Workflow

1. **Branch Structure:**
   - `main` - Production-ready code
   - `develop` - Integration branch
   - `feature/*` - Feature branches
   - `hotfix/*` - Critical bug fixes
   - `release/*` - Release preparation

2. **Pull Request Process:**
   - Create PR from feature branch to develop
   - Require at least 2 code reviews
   - Pass automated tests
   - Documentation updated
   - Domain review when applicable

### CI/CD Pipeline

1. **Continuous Integration:**
   - Automated builds on PR creation
   - Unit tests execution
   - Code quality checks (linting, complexity, etc.)
   - Security scans

2. **Continuous Deployment:**
   - Automated deployments to dev environment
   - Manual approval for staging deployment
   - Integration tests on staging
   - Manual approval for production

### Domain-Driven Design Practices

1. **Bounded Context Mapping:**
   - Document context boundaries
   - Define integration patterns between contexts
   - Regular context map reviews

2. **Ubiquitous Language:**

   - Mitigation: Dedicated refactoring sprints, debt quotas

3. **Integration Challenges**
   - Risk: Difficult integration between bounded contexts
   - Mitigation: Clear context mapping, anti-corruption layers

4. **Knowledge Silos**
   - Risk: Critical knowledge limited to few team members
   - Mitigation: Pair programming rotation, knowledge sharing sessions
